# Talking About Your Best Self: Speaking Highly of Your Own Work and Accomplishments

This SOL will show students how to speak highly of their abilities and accomplishments, a skill that many early career women struggle with. Presenters will discuss what it means to speak highly of yourself and why and when it is important. Attendees will compare sample resumes for how strongly they represent a candidate; attendees will also roleplay speaking highly of themselves in conversation.
